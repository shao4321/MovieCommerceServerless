## Description

> An e-commerce website that allows users to browse for the movie they like and add it into the shopping cart. Movies are a subset of movies taken from https://www.themoviedb.org/ that is stored in JSON files and retrieved from the repository. There are functions such as filtering and sorting the movies based on their preferences.

> Movies that are added into the shopping cart are stored and loaded from the sessionstorage API. (Data will disappear after the page browser is closed)

### Challenges

1. Retrieving movies from a huge database causes performance issue and so I decided to split the movies into many pages and load them when they are navigated.
2. Separation of all the movies into different pages requires me to allocate a proper data structure to store them so that it can be retrieved efficiently.

### Improvements

1. Integrate a checkout counter.
2. Build an user login and authentication system.
3. Keep track of the shopping cart items based on the users' login particulars.

### Technologies

1. SASS
2. Material-UI
3. React
   - React Hooks
   - React Router DOM
   - React Transition Group

> SASS has provided me with easy styling syntax and functions with the use of nesting and mixins.

> Some components on the website are built by Material-UI. These components has certain CSS properties that supports modern web browser styles.

> Ever since I have started on React, I feel that this is an essentially frontend web framework that I have to master.
